# CarRental

Project made in two weeks and a half about a fictional car rental service website for a fictional company

Said project was developed in a team of 6 people and is the culmination of a 3 month intensive course I've attended starting September 20, 2022

Sch course was mainly focused around Java and Spring Boot but technologies and languages such as MySQL and JavaScript have also been studied briefly, HTML and CSS too

Everything that was learnt during that 3 months period has been put to work inside this project.
